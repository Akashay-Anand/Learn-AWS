- In the past, organizations hosted and maintained hardware such as compute, storage, and networking equipment in their own data centers. which is termed as ‘on-premises’ systems.
- And they needed to allocate entire infrastructure departments to take care of them.

> 🤔𝘚𝘰 𝘭𝘦𝘵’𝘴 𝘴𝘦𝘦 𝘢𝘯 𝘌𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦:

Let’s suppose I have a web Application called ‘YouPost’ like ‘YouTube’, where anyone can post content and interact with it.
What I required for this:
- I need storage to store all the contents, been uploaded worldwide
- I need a server to host the site;
- need proper networking system to server content to authenticated IP or user only, and also to protect against unauthorized access or manipulation

>❓𝘐𝘴𝘴𝘶𝘦 /𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘳𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦𝘴:

well, we can establish an entire system by hiring new people and resources…
>> So what issue with it:

Infrastructure establishment cost, there would be some periodic costs as well. 📊
New people bring chances of human error with them unless they are highly professional. 🤖
hardware damage cost(human fault, connection fault, nature fault… anything can happen)
you need to create a 𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘵𝘭𝘦 𝘈𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘢 in your server room ☃️❄️
> So the point is: This would be feasible for a large company with ample resources, but for a small organization, it would be tough.💵🪙

> and to reliable choice would be to outsource their work to other providers who can maintain and provide these resources through the internet 🤝

As Internet usage became more widespread, the demand for compute, storage, and networking equipment increased. For some companies and organizations, the cost of maintaining a large physical presence was unsustainable. To solve this problem, cloud computing was created.🎯

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources from a distance location using the Internet. 🤌🏻🌐

There are multiple companies that have huge market caps and lots of resources, they provide these IT resources(i.e. Servers, storage, networking, computational, and e.t.c) through their online platform. 💹

The first cloud services were primarily focused on providing storage and compute resources. However, as cloud computing has become more mature and widely adopted, it has expanded to include a wide range of services, such as databases, networking, analytics, and artificial intelligence📈

Another key driver of cloud computing evolution has been the increasing adoption of open-source software. This has made it possible for cloud providers to offer a wider range of services at a lower cost. 🆓

Cloud computing has made it easier and more affordable for businesses to start up and scale. 👨🏻‍💻👩🏻‍💻
