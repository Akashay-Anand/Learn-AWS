# AWS Jargons (KeyWords) & Dashboard

#Day06 of #100DaysofAWS

Throughout this journey, you may hear lots of wordsâ€¦

and most probably you end up with this question why the hell did they end up using this keyword to name anything?

# ðŸ¤– Let's Decode This terminology.

**Cloud:** It resources located in a remote location and can be accessed through the internet

**Compute:** As your own computer has the capability/power to run applications, execute basic Input Output, or do calculations, this power is termed compute power. So the provider should also provide

**Elastic:** As stretchable materials(Elastic) donâ€™t break when loads increase on it, instead it expands itself. Similarly, the â€˜Elasticâ€™ word is used with resources that have the capability to adjust themselves as per requirement

- In the cloud context expanding or contraction of cloud resources on demand is referred to as â€˜Scalingâ€™. (you will hear this term scale-up, scale-down, horizontal scaling, vertical scaling. in future)

**Instance:** Instance refers to a unit.

- Ex: Letâ€™s assume that my company has set up 50 computers for office work. So, the entire office is considered an ecosystem, and 1 computer in that office is referred as an Instance.
- we can add an instance or remove it as per our need.
- In the cloud we create a VM(Virtual Machine) and that VM is referred as Instances

**Container:** In simple words, it is an isolated box that contains everything for particular software to execute and work properlyâ€¦

- So, this concept helps to remove the dependency issue.
- Ex: â€” As a developer, I build software using java-7 and upload it on any platform for client access or team access.
-- So, what is the issue hereâ€¦?
--- It might be possible that the client has the latest Java version(17) installed which doesnâ€™t support old libraries. Hence the software may crash or generate errors/warnings.
- Now to resolve this, the Container concept is been used. & In this, we pack every required thing (like- OS, runtime, language, tools) including software in one box/container and ship the entire box on the platform. Hence our software will not be dependent on the client-side environment, Instead, it takes whatever it needs from the box only.
- To perform this we use Docker.

**AWS Management Console:** The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface that allows you to access and manage your AWS resources through a user-friendly dashboard.

**SDK(software development kit):** It is a set of software development tools and libraries provided by AWS to make it easier for developers to interact with and use AWS services in their applications and software projects.
- Libraries for integrating AWS services into applications.

**CLI(Command Line Interface):** Allows programmatic access to AWS services via the command line.

- It is a text-based interface that allows you to perform a wide range of tasks related to AWS resources and services without the need for a graphical user interface.


## Management Console ( Dashboard )
It is important to have a bird's eye view of the dashboard, So, you won't get lost init.
