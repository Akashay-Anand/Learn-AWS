# Cloud Revolutions


> ⌛ The first cloud computing services were offered in the early 2000s by companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce. Where initial offerings are basic infrastructure services, such as computing power, storage, and networking.

📆 Over the years, cloud services have evolved to include a wide range of offerings, such as:

- IaaS (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud)
- PaaS (e.g., Heroku, Google App Engine)
- SaaS (e.g., Salesforce, Dropbox)
- FaaS (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- DaaS (Data as a Service)
- CaaS (Container as a Service)

> 👩🏻‍💻📈With increasing popularity and use cases, the cloud is becoming the first choice for any established organization or growing startup. And that’s why a major chunk of 🤵🏻🤷🏻‍♂️ user data is flowing through cloud services nowadays.

💹 So, it is obvious that the cloud market would be huge ?!!!!
🤌🏻A recent report from ‘𝘍𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘶𝘯𝘦 𝘉𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘐𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵𝘴’ that states the global cloud computing market size was valued at $569.31 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.0% from $677.95 billion in 2023 to $2,432.87 billion by 2030🦊

Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Microsoft Azure
Google Cloud Platform
IBM Cloud
Alibaba Cloud
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
🤔What is the difference between all
🤝All these providers do provide most of the similar and needed services with some add-ons. Another may be the prices of their services.

🤴🏻As competition is also there. So the benefit in this is consumers in terms of getting things at cheap or affordable models like pay-per-use, etc…

> **⁉️ So which one is popular**

- In this, AWS enjoys the title. And the reason is innovation and early initiatives.
- In the 2000s they started (first come advantage)
- Constantly adding more services and improving others as per market norms.
- Huge community buildup.
- Richling out to the young generation with lots of innovative Events
Huge learning community and resources.

> 🤖 Well, Google Cloud also has a big community and educates through QwikLabs, etc;
but. I feel their online educators and resources are not that much visible….

> 📝Conclusion: we can start with any cloud i.e. GCP AWS or Azure, as all provide access to their portal for learning.
More specifically learn basic cloud, start with AWS then migrate to GCP or Azure or other cloud platform If needed.
