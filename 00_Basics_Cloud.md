**Private cloud:**
>  A private cloud is a cloud computing environment that is hosted on-premises by an organization. This means that the hardware, software, and networking infrastructure that supports the private cloud is owned and operated by the organization.Ex: **VMware**

**Public Cloud:**
> A public cloud is a cloud computing model in which the hardware, software, and networking infrastructure are owned and operated by a cloud service provider and made available to the general public over the internet. Ex. **AWS**

**Hybrid cloud:** 
> A hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment that combines a private cloud with a public cloud. This means that some workloads are hosted on-premises in the private cloud, while other workloads are hosted in the public cloud.

**[Note:]** AWS can be used to create hybrid cloud environments. This means that AWS resources can be combined with on-premises resources to create a single, cohesive IT environment.
