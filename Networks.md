### WHAT ARE IP ADDRESSES?

- An IP address, which stands for "Internet Protocol address," is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- IP address uses a combination of bits, 0s and 1s.

- example of a 32-bit address in binary format: 
 - 11000000 10101000 00000001 00011110
