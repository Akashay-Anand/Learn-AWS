# Understanding Servers

The first building block you need to host an application is a server. 

Servers often times can handle Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and send responses to clients following the __client-server model__, though any API based communication also falls under this model.

A client being a person or computer that sends a request, and a server handling the requests is a computer, or collection of computers, connected to the internet serving websites to internet users. 

These servers power your application by providing CPU, memory, and networking capacity to process users’ requests and transform them into responses. 

_For context, common HTTP servers include⤵️_

* Windows options, such as Internet Information Services (IIS).
* Linux options, such as Apache HTTP Web Server, Nginx, and Apache Tomcat.

> To run an HTTP server on AWS, you need to find a service that provides compute power in the AWS Management Console.
