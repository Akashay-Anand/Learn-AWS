# Hypervisor

> Hypervisor is a software program that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on the same physical server. The hypervisor allocates resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each VM so that they can run independently of each other.

* Type 1 hypervisors are also known as bare-metal hypervisors. They are installed directly on the physical hardware, and they do not require an operating system. This makes them very efficient, but they also require more technical expertise to set up and manage.
* > If you need a high-performance VM group, then you should choose a type 1 hypervisor
* Type 2 hypervisors are installed on top of an operating system. This makes them easier to set up and manage, but they are not as efficient as type 1 hypervisors.
* > If you need a VM group that is easy to set up and manage, then you should choose a type 2 hypervisor

> When you create a VM group for a hypervisor for AWS, you are essentially creating a group of VMs that will be managed by the hypervisor. The hypervisor will ensure that each VM has the resources it needs to run properly, and it will also prevent VMs from interfering with each other

__[Note]:__ Amazon Web Services (AWS), you don't typically work with a hypervisor directly like you might in a traditional virtualization environment. Instead, In AWS, when you launch an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance, you are creating a virtual machine, but you don't interact with the hypervisor directly. AWS handles the hypervisor layer and provides you with a variety of instance types that offer different levels of CPU, memory, and other resources.

## Types of Hypervisor used by AWS for VM's

1. __Xen__  
Xen is an __open-source__ hypervisor that provides virtualization technology to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine simultaneously. It is designed to create isolated environments called "virtual machines" (VMs) or "guests" on a host system. Each virtual machine operates independently as if it were running on its own dedicated hardware while sharing the physical resources of the host machine.

* __Hypervisor Architecture__: Xen operates as a Type 1 hypervisor, also known as a "bare-metal" hypervisor. This means it runs directly on the hardware without needing a host operating system. This architecture enhances performance and security

* __Paravirtualization and Hardware Virtualization__: Xen initially introduced the concept of paravirtualization, which involves modifying guest operating systems to be aware of the hypervisor, resulting in optimized performance and better resource utilization. Over time, Xen also incorporated hardware virtualization extensions (such as Intel VT-x and AMD-V), enabling the virtualization of unmodified operating systems.

* __Isolation and Resource Allocation__: Xen ensures strong isolation between virtual machines, enhancing security and stability. It provides tools for administrators to allocate CPU, memory, storage, and network resources to each VM.

* __Multiple Operating Systems__: Xen supports running a variety of guest operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and other Unix-like systems. These guest operating systems can run concurrently on the same physical hardware.

* __Performance__: Xen's architecture typically results in minimal overhead compared to traditional virtualization solutions

2. __Nitro__
The Nitro Hypervisor is a lightweight, high-performance hypervisor developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a fundamental component of the Nitro System. it is a bare-metal hypervisor that replaces the Xen hypervisor previously used in EC2 instances. It's specifically designed to offload most of the virtualization work from the main host CPU to dedicated hardware components. This approach improves overall instance performance and security.

* _Bare-Metal Hypervisor_: Similar to other Type 1 hypervisor, the Nitro Hypervisor is a "bare-metal" hypervisor, meaning it runs directly on the physical hardware without the need for an underlying host operating system. This architecture minimizes overhead and maximizes performance.

* _Hardware Offloading_: One of the core advantages of the Nitro Hypervisor is its ability to offload virtualization tasks to dedicated hardware components. This includes tasks related to memory management, CPU scheduling, and interrupt handling. By offloading these tasks, the main CPU is freed up to focus on executing application workloads.

* _Isolation and Security_: The Nitro Hypervisor provides strong isolation between instances, ensuring that workloads are isolated from each other

> The Nitro Hypervisor is part of AWS's continuous effort to optimize the performance and capabilities of its cloud services. As AWS services evolve, the Nitro System and its components play a crucial role in delivering efficient, secure, and scalable infrastructure to customers.

# EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)

> It is a cloud computing service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. With EC2, you can launch as many or as few virtual machines (VMs) as you need, and scale them up or down as your needs change. You can also customize your VMs with the operating system, storage, and networking that you need.
* EC2 is a pay-as-you-go service, so you only pay for the resources that you use.

### EC2 is a popular choice for a variety of workloads, including:
* Web servers
* Database servers
* Application servers
* Development and testing environments
* High-performance computing (HPC)
* Machine learning

<br/>

> When you launch an EC2 instance in AWS, you're essentially creating a virtual machine
> Each instance is backed by the AWS infrastructure, including the hypervisor layer, but you don't need to interact with the hypervisor itself.

### Overall Concept

> A virtual machine can often be the easiest compute option in AWS to understand. This is because a virtual machine emulates a physical server and allows you to install an HTTP server to run your applications.

> To run these virtual machines, you install a hypervisor on a host machine. This hypervisor provisions the resources to create and run your virtual machines.

> In AWS, these virtual machines are called Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or Amazon EC2. Behind the scenes, AWS operates and manages the host machines and the hypervisor layer. AWS also installs the virtual machine operating system, called the guest operating system

> Some AWS compute services use Amazon EC2 or use virtualization concepts under the hood.

<hr/>

### EC2 Instance Lifecycle
> An EC2 instance transitions between different states from the moment you create it all the way through to its termination

> <img width="872" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Akashay-Anand/Learn-AWS/assets/82114930/a54e67e9-27f6-4bc7-abcd-09ecf3590b50">

Q) Where Does Your EC2 Instance Live?
> By default, your EC2 instances are placed in a network called the default Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This network was created so that you can easily get started with Amazon EC2 without having to learn how to create and configure a VPC. any resource you put inside the default VPC will be public and accessible by the internet,     

Q) What Is the Difference Between Stop and Stop-Hibernate?
> When you stop your instance, the data stored in memory (RAM) is lost. When you stop-hibernate your instance, AWS signals the operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk), which saves the contents from the instance memory (RAM) to the Amazon EBS root volume.    

> When you stop your instance, it enters the stopping state, and then the stopped state. AWS does not charge usage or data transfer fees for your instance after you stop it, but storage for any Amazon EBS volumes is still charged. While your instance is in the stopped state, you can modify some attributes, like the instance type.




<hr/>

## EC2 Configuration

> We can create and manage EC2 instances through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), or through automation tools and infrastructure orchestration services. In order to create an EC2 instance, you need to define:

* Hardware specifications, like CPU, memory, network, and storage.
* Logical configurations, like networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and the operating system of your choice.

When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting we configure is the operating system.(selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)).

<br/>

### What Is an AMI?
> AMI let you configure which operating system you want, you can also select storage mappings, the architecture type (such as 32-bit, 64-bit, or 64-bit ARM), and additional software installed.

> EC2 instances are live instantiations of what is defined in an AMI, much like a cake is a live instantiation of a cake recipe

> One advantage of using AMIs is that they are reusable.

Q) _If you wanted to create a second EC2 instance with the same configurations, how can you easily do that?_   
> create an AMI from your running instance and use this AMI to start a new instance. This way, your new instance will have all the same configurations as your current instance, because the configurations set in the AMIs are the same.
