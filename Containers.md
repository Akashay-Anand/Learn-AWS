# Containers

> While containers are often referred to as a new technology, the idea started in the 1970s with certain Linux kernels having the ability to separate their processes through isolation. At the time, this was configured manually, making operations complex.With the evolution of the open source software community, containers evolved. Today, containers are used as a solution to problems of traditional compute, including the issue of getting software to run reliably when it moves from one compute environment to another.

> A container is a standardized unit that packages up your code and all of its dependencies. This package is designed to run reliably on any platform, because the container creates its own independent environment. This makes it easy to carry workloads from one place to another, such as from development to production or from on-premises to the cloud.

## WHAT IS DOCKER?
* When you hear the word container, you may associate it with Docker. 
* Docker is a popular container runtime that simplifies the management of the entire operating system stack needed for container isolation, including networking and storage. Docker makes it easy to create, package, deploy, and run containers.

## ORCHESTRATE CONTAINERS
In AWS, containers run on EC2 instances. For example, you may have a large instance and run a few containers on that instance.While running one instance is easy to manage, it lacks high availability and scalability. Most companies and organizations run many containers on many EC2 instances across several Availability Zones.If youâ€™re trying to manage your compute at a large scale, you need to know:

* How to place your containers on your instances.
* What happens if your container fails.
* What happens if your instance fails.
* How to monitor deployments of your containers.

This coordination is handled by a container orchestration service. AWS offers two container orchestration services: Amazon __Elastic Container Service (ECS)__ and Amazon __Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)__.

1. __MANAGE CONTAINERS WITH AMAZON ELASTIC CONTAINER SERVICE (AMAZON ECS)__

> ECS is an end-to-end container orchestration service that allows you to quickly spin up new containers and manage them across a cluster of EC2 instances.

> To run and manage your containers, you need to install the Amazon ECS Container Agent on your EC2 instances. This agent is open source and responsible for communicating back to the Amazon ECS service about cluster management details. You can run this agent on both Linux and Windows AMIs. An instance with the container agent installed is often called a container instance.

2. __USE KUBERNETES WITH AMAZON ELASTIC KUBERNETES SERVICE (AMAZON EKS)__

> Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. By bringing software development and operations together by design, Kubernetes created a rapidly growing ecosystem that is very popular and well established in the market.If you already use Kubernetes, you can use Amazon EKS to orchestrate these workloads in the AWS Cloud.Amazon EKS is conceptually similar to Amazon ECS, but there are some differences.

* An EC2 instance with the ECS Agent installed and configured is called a container instance. In Amazon EKS, it is called a worker node.
* An ECS Container is called a task. In the Amazon EKS ecosystem, it is called a pod.
* While Amazon ECS runs on AWS native technology, Amazon EKS runs on top of Kubernetes.

> If you have containers running on Kubernetes and want an advanced orchestration solution that can provide simplicity, high availability, and fine-grained control over your infrastructure, Amazon EKS is the tool for you.

<hr/>

[Note]:
* ECS or EKS is the container orchestrator. This is the tool that is managing the container's lifecycle.
* ECS and EKS run containers on clusters of EC2 instances. And in that case, you were using EC2 as the compute platform for your containers,
